Notes on Github

Creating a branch: 

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.

Commit changes: 

Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch.

Getting a pull request:

Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository, anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request.


Working together:

Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team reviewing your changes may have questions or comments. Pull Requests are designed to encourage and capture this type of conversation.


Forking: 

Duplicating a repository into your own account. 

Markdown language: 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
